      Larger women lament across social media threads, blog posts, and YouTube videos on the scarcity of stylish, well-fitting pieces in larger sizes. Many brands don’t even carry larger sizes and when they do they’re the same garish, tacky and tasteless clothes.

      Men in leadership positions who dictate fashion trends, such as Karl Lagerfeld, head designer of Chanel, said in 2009, “No one wants to see curvy women” on the runway. Plenty of mass retailers are no more enlightened: Under the tenure of chief executive Mike Jeffries, Abercrombie & Fitch sold nothing larger than a size 10, with Jeffries explaining that “we go after the attractive, all-American kid.”

      Despite the endless outcry online with many news articles focusing on the lack of options, little data illustrates just how inferior the offerings made to plus-size women are compared to their thinner counterparts. I cataloged the number of silhouettes, colorways, and design details available in plus-size versus standard-size ranges across Barcelona-based brand Mango, which has a sizeable presence in the US shopping market.
