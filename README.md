**Introduction**

This news app is an effort into displaying the inferior choices offered to larger women, described by most brands as plus-size. It sheds light on the differences between clothes (specifically, dresses in this project) offered to thinner women vs larger women in terms of silhouettes, drapes, patterns, necklines, etc. It does so through the example of Barcelona based brand, Mango, which has a sizeable presence in the US fashion market. The differences are shown mostly visually but also differentiates between the offerings based on descriptions offered by the brand. 

**Deployed aspects of this project:**

The "deployed" aspect is within codespaces. Please right click on index.html and Open With Live Server. index.html (homepage) and silhouette.html(path trace animation) are the only public aspects of the code. The other files are mostly files generating json to feed into index.html, Python files that scraped the website to generate CSV files (which were later converted to json), other Python files to use computer vision and generate masks and contour lines from product and model images, SVG files for the path trace animation. Silhouette.html is linked within index.html.
